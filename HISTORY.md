# Revision History for kpointTests

## Revision 0.6.0
- Added data for additional elemnts to the repo as well as an updated
  plot that uses the Mueller grids that don't have the gamma point.
- Added directory for writeup of findings.

## Revision 0.5.0
- Added plots of the time scaling for generating the complete list of HNFs.

## Revision 0.4.0
- Added a mathematica file to the scripts folder that computes the
  number of cells needed to fill a sphere of a given cutoff radius. It
  then finds the number of HNFs for that number of cells.

## Revision 0.3.0

- Added a new mode that plots the convergence of all runs for each element on a single plot.
- Added figures produced from the new mode.

## Revision 0.2.1

- Fixed a typo on the axis labels.
- Made the individual plots log log.
- Changed default plot range on *_vs_Mueller plots.

## Revision 0.2.0

- Added 3 atom cells back to the models.
- Fixed some errors that had occured in the Froyen tests.
- Added an additional hcp test case to the Fropen tests.

## Revision 0.1.0

- Updated scripts for multiple Froyen grids {i.e. sc, bcc, fcc, hcp}.
- Added new data for multiple Froyen grids.
- Updated all figures.

## Revision 0.0.1

Inital commit to the repo of the data and the scripts.
